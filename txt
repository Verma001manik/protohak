what are we building ? 
tcp based chat room protocol 


what are the requirements?
first the client connects to the server

do we join him instantly ?
no 
then how 

the server asks the client for his name
the client gives his name 
atleast 1 character and max 16 characters of alphanumeric 

unique names? 
yes 

if illegal name , disconnect the client without informing anyone 


when name is given 
server will make the name join the room 
and announce to everone in the room that the new name has joined the room 

ex:  "A user joins"

and also the server must list the names of everyone present in the room (present)  except the newer client
to the newer client


The room contains: bob, charlie, dave


--> Welcome to budgetchat! What shall I call you?
<-- alice
--> * The room contains: bob, charlie, dave
<-- Hello everyone
--> [bob] hi alice
--> [charlie] hello alice
--> * dave has left the room

this is the typical workflow 

so the typical proces must be something like below 

we need a server with multiple clients
single client is not possible because we need other people to chat 

so we need to store the connected users and also people in the room 

what is the difference? 
the connected users do not have a name for now , but people in the room do ? 
should we include people who are in the room to be included in the connected list? 
yeah that could be possible or we could create another list of people with no names and when broadcasting the 
message we could just send the messgae to the room list that would be alright 

i think room list is good for us to broacast message 
if someone from connected list creates their name, they will be added to this room list 
yeah that seems nice to me 


Upon connection
    Setting the user's name


    Presence notification

    Chat messages


the client is getting disconnected , we need to prevent this shit 
from happening 

how to take input from the client when connected to the server 

how to send messages to selected people 
how to send 'user joined' message to selected people 

how can the server send to above people 

we need to store the conn object of the client
why 
we need to send message sometimes to selected people and sometimes to single person 
for sending the above message , we need the client object

so should we also 

we need to sendto to each client that user has joined 
that means something like 

for user that is not the new user:
    send message that new user has joined
