what is given 

we need to create a proxy server
but what is proxy server

it is a server that is between the client and server 

so that means we need to connect to both the client and the server
yes

we need to pass message from client to upstream server and backandforth
but we are in the middle 



when the client sends message to the proxy , let proxy send it to upstream server
and vice versa


so if a client is connected to my proxy , i need to make a request to server

server will give me 'hey what is your name' 
i will send this message to client 
clietn says bob , i send bob to server
and so on...


the only catch is we need to modify the address that the client passes and change it 
so 

A substring is considered to be a Boguscoin address if it satisfies all of:

    it starts with a "7"
    it consists of at least 26, and at most 35, alphanumeric characters
    it starts at the start of a chat message, or is preceded by a space
    it ends at the end of a chat message, or is followed by a space

change the client bogus address to tonys adress which is 7YWHMfk9JZe0LM0g1ZauHuiSxhI


ok so the first thing would be to 

first receive the data from the client 
send that data to the upstream server
